    "The primary goal of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is to model real-world entities and their interactions within a software system by organizing code into objects. OOP is a programming paradigm that emphasizes the use of objects, which are instances of classes, to represent data and behavior. Here are the key objectives or goals of OOP:\n",
    "\n",
    "Modularity: OOP promotes modularity by breaking down complex problems into smaller, manageable units called objects. Each object encapsulates its own state (data) and behavior (methods), making it easier to understand and maintain the codebase.\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the concept of bundling data and methods that operate on that data within a single unit (the object). It allows the internal workings of an object to be hidden from the outside world, providing a clear interface for interacting with the object. This enhances data security and reduces the risk of unintended side effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction: Abstraction allows you to create simplified representations of real-world objects in your code. It focuses on essential characteristics while hiding unnecessary details, making the code more intuitive and easier to work with.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance: Inheritance is a mechanism that allows a class (subclass) to inherit properties and behaviors from another class (superclass). It enables code reusability, as subclasses can extend and specialize the functionality of their parent classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism: Polymorphism enables objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. This means that multiple classes can have methods with the same name but perform different actions based on their specific implementations. Polymorphism enhances flexibility and extensibility in the codebase.\n",
    "\n",
    "By achieving these goals, OOP helps developers build more organized, flexible, and maintainable software systems. It encourages code reusability, reduces redundancy, and facilitates collaborative development by enabling teams to work on different parts of the system independently."

    "In Python, an object is a fundamental concept that represents a specific instance of a class. Python is an object-oriented programming language, which means that almost everything in Python is an object. \n",
    "Python objects have the following characteristics:\n",
    "\n",
    "Identity: Each object in Python has a unique identity, which is a unique identifier associated with it. You can obtain the identity of an object using the id() function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Type: Each object belongs to a specific type (also known as class), which defines the attributes and methods that the object can have and the operations it can perform.\n",
    "\n",
    "Value: The value is the actual data stored within the object. For example, in the case of an integer object, the value might be the number itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Attributes: Objects can have attributes, which are variables that store data within the object. For instance, a list object has attributes that store the elements of the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Methods: Objects can have methods, which are functions that can operate on the object's data. For example, a list object has methods like append(), pop(), and sort() that allow you to manipulate the list.\n",
